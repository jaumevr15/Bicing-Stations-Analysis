## Project Description
This project is meant to analyze and understand the behaviour of Bicing bike-sharing service stations in the city of Barcelona by using the Clusters method to identify patterns that can help solving uneven bike distribution, especially at workdays rush hour.

## Hypotheses / Questions
* Bike stations seem to follow certain patterns of how full/empty the station can be depending on the time of the day.
* Depending on their location and on the surroundings, some stations tend to be often full or often empty at rush hour.
* Bicing bike-sharing system based in dock-stations limit the amount of bikes that can be left or taken, being sometimes unable to absorb the demand of users.
* This project pretends to identify these patterns, understand their behaviour and by locating the stations that are more vulnerable to be full or empty in certain times.
* Once patterns are identified and clusters can be located on a map, can the suggested clusters distribution assist on finding a solution to prevent stations meeting users needs?


## Dataset
* Where did you get your data? If you downloaded a dataset (either public or private), describe where you downloaded it and include the command to load the dataset.
* Did you build your own datset? If so, did you use an API or a web scraper? PRovide the relevant scripts in your repo.
* For all types of datasets, provide a description of the size, complexity, and data types included in your dataset, as well as a schema of the tables if necessary.
* If the question cannot be answered with the available data, why not? What data would you need to answer it better?

## Cleaning
Describe your full process of data wrangling and cleaning. Document why you chose to fill missing values, extract outliers, or create the variables you did as well as your reasoning behind the process.

## Analysis
* Overview the general steps you went through to analyze your data in order to test your hypothesis.
* Document each step of your data exploration and analysis.
* Include charts to demonstrate the effect of your work.
* If you used Machine Learning in your final project, describe your feature selection process.

## Model Training and Evaluation
*Include this section only if you chose to include ML in your project.*
* Describe how you trained your model, the results you obtained, and how you evaluated those results.

## Conclusion
* Summarize your results. What do they mean?
* What can you say about your hypotheses?
* Interpret your findings in terms of the questions you try to answer.

## Future Work
Address any questions you were unable to answer, or any next steps or future extensions to your project.

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What were the steps?
How did you test the accuracy of your analysis and/or machine learning algorithm?

## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a trello or kanban board?
